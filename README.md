<h1>CalcuWaste-App</h1>
Repository for Bangkit 2023 Product-Based Capstone for CalcuWaste by C23-PR581 

<h1>CalcuWaste</h1>
CalcuWaste is a mobile application that enables the user to calculate the CO2 equivalent that can be saved by recycling, and its economic value, and connect them with the nearby waste bank to ensure a better experience in recycling.
Here is the feature of the CalcuWaste app:
<h2>Main Feature:</h2>
Calculate carbon emission reduction and economic value of the recyclable if recycled according to its category (plastic, metal, aluminum, etc.)
Keep track of (accounts) reduced carbon emission and total economic value of each user account throughout the history of application usage
Find nearest recycling centers/waste banks that accept the recyclable category
<h2>Additional Feature:</h2>
Connect the users with the recycling centers/waste banks to conduct transactions of the recyclable
Accounts overall carbon emission of the equipment used by an individual or SMEs



<h1>Background</h1>
Indonesia is one of the major producers of industrial products and emits enormous amounts of carbon emissions from industrial processes. To accelerate net zero emission in the 2060 target, Indonesian society can start recycling. The gap is that Indonesia's recycling rates are relatively low, which is still around 11%. To suppress the existing gap with recycling, we can spread awareness in society about how valuable their recyclables are in terms of carbon emission reduction and economic value.
To support this, CalcuWaste provides information about emissions and the economic value of the recyclable. In addition, users can find and connect to the nearest waste bank. Our additional unique selling point is CalcuWaste is the only platform to do carbon accounting for tangible assets of individuals, institutions, events, and SMEs. We utilize the strong opportunity where the awareness of youth toward the environment is exceptionally high, including recycling and carbon accounting. These are the vital reasons why CalcuWaste needs to exist for helping Indonesian society in sustainable ways.

<h1>Installation</h1>
This section is intended to explain to the users how to install our app. #coming soon

<h1>How This Application Works</h1>
How our app is used is relatively simple, the user only needs to log in and upload a recyclable image and its weight/size to show its carbon emission saving, economic value, nearby waste banks that can accommodate it, and connect them with the waste bank.

<h1>API Documentation</h1>
We also provide API documentation that can be accessed here #coming soon

<h1>Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, and Mobile Development</h1>
For those who are interested in the detailed explanation of each learning path, you can access it through each learning path.
